## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the Calkit GitHub organization homepage!

Calkit's mission is to help make every scientific study reproducible,
which means anyone can download a project and go from raw data to
research article with a single command.
We seek to do this without forcing scientists to become software
engineering experts by providing simplified and unified
interfaces on top of powerful software development tools like Git,
DVC, uv, Docker, and even GitHub.

All of our software is free and open source, and we're always
looking for new contributors,
so if you also care about making reproducibility easier,
reach out at info@calkit.org or 
[start a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/calkit/discussions).

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

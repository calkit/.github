Calkit's mission is to help make every scientific study reproducible,
i.e., anyone should be able to download a project and go from raw data to
research article with a single command.
We seek to do this without forcing scientists to become software
engineering experts by providing simplified and unified
interfaces on top of powerful software development tools like Git,
DVC, uv, Docker, and even GitHub.

If you're a scientist or researcher looking to improve the 
reproducibility and automation of your work you can 
[get started here](https://github.com/calkit/calkit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

All of our software is free and open source, and we're always
looking for new contributors,
so if you also care about making reproducibility easier,
reach out at info@calkit.org or 
[start a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/calkit/discussions).
